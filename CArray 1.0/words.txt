along the shore the cloud waves break 
the twin suns sink beneath the lake 
the shadows lengthen
in carcosa

strange is the night where black stars rise
and strange moons circle through the skies 
but stranger still is
lost carcosa

songs that the hyades shall sing
where flap the tatters of the king
must die unheard in
dim carcosa

song of my soul my voice is dead
die thou unsung as tears unshed 
shall dry and die in
lost carcosa
